Cyrillic Software Suite

All Russian WEB sites have to provide different encodings of Russian texts.
Four main encodings are CP1251 for Windows, KOI8 for UNIX, MAC for Macintosh
and transliteration for users accepting only English texts. 

This suite is intended for webmasters solving various issues related to
multiple charsets.
